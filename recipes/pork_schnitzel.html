    <br />
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 boneless, centre-cut pork loin chops</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
      <li>2 cups dried plain or seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 - 1 tsp seasoning salt</li>
      <li>Vegetable, canola, peanut or sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Trim pork chops of fat and slice into 1/2″-thick cutlets (I used 3 large
        Costco-sized pork chops and after slicing ended up with 9 pieces). Line
        a cutting board with plastic wrap, place cutlets in a single layer on
        cutting board and cover with plastic wrap (this prevents splatter).
        Pound cutlets with a meat mallet or the back of a heavy saucepan, until
        1/4″ to 1/8″ thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up three bowls. In the first combine 1/3 cup flour, 1 Tbsp garlic
        salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp pepper. In the second, use a fork to
        beat 3 eggs. In the third bowl, add 2 cups of crumbs
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge both sides of each pounded cutlet in flour then dip in beaten egg
        letting excess egg drip back into the bowl before breading in panko
        crumbs. It helps to use a fork for the dipping process to keep your
        hands clean. Repeat with remaining cutlets
      </li>
      <li>
        Once all cutlets are breaded, heat a large non-stick pan over medium
        heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Once oil is hot,
        add breaded cutlets a few at a time and sauté 3-4 minutes per side or
        until cooked through. Reduce heat if cutlets are browning too quickly.
        Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Cut into one to double check
        doneness – juices should run clear. Serve right away with lemon wedges,
        or ranch for the children
